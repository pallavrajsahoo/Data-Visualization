# Assignment: Visualizing government debt  
## Government Debt Bar Chart

Below bar chart is simple to interpret. If you hover over a bar for a particular country, you can easily view the Ratio, which is easy to interpret rather than looking at the aligning y-axis to find the Ratio. It has sources mentioned to acknowledge the credibility. Overall, it is a good visualizaation.

## Grid of Line Charts

This line charts is a way good representation for Debt to GDP Ratio. One can view and juxtapose the ratio with all other countries and is convienient as it is happenning all in one place. If you hover over the line for a country, you view the Ratio for every year. This is a nice touch where the audience can see the Ratio for all years available for a particular country.  I have chosen blue as it is cooler to the eyes and not distracting. here, I have alos added a title and a subtitle to give the audience little context. Finally, to have a uniformity, all the text and charts are left-alligned.

## Third Data Visualization

In this visualization, I used the Area Chart (Stacked) variant to show my idea of Debt to GDP ratio. It shows the depth which corelates to the Debt to GDP ratio. I have chosen blue as it is cooler and would not distract the audience. I have also added a title and a subtitle to show the audience what they looking for. Sure, I have heading for this entire page on the top but after scolling down and looking at all these visualizations, one can forget the context. Also, all the text and charts are left-alligned.
