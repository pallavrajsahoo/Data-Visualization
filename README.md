# About Me
Hi Everyone! 
I am Pallavraj Sahoo (He/Him) and I am from India. I am currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s degree in Information System and Management at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). I have tailored my course path with courses like Data Focused Python and Database Management to gain experience in data and its applications. Further, the projects conducted as a part of the coursework have enhanced my knowledge and helped me develop skills such as performing ETL on large datasets, having an analytical approach to problems and adding data science tools to my toolbox. As an instance, in one of my projects based on optimizing the inventory stocks by predicting the reorder rate and providing recommendation, I built a skill on understanding a business requirement, mining for relevant insights, and solving the problem using an analytical approach. 

I am passionate about Data and I like sketching. So, one might say I like Data Visualization. To improve my data visualization skills, I have taken Telling Stories with Data. I have some familiarity with Tableau and basic data visualization. However, after attending two classes, I realized that I have a lot to learn to improve my skills

Fun fact about me: I have lived in 6 different cities and my favorite food is Pizza.
